h1: Getting started with complate

Pattern Libraries
-----------------

We often develop our complate components using a pattern library.
The following pattern libraries support complate:

* [Fractal](https://github.com/complate/complate-fractal) ([Sample project](https://github.com/complate/complate-sample-fractal))
* [aiur](https://github.com/moonglum/aiur)

Adaptors for Server-Side Rendering
----------------------------------

With complate we have adaptors so that we can reuse our components for server-side rendering across multiple platforms.

The following platforms currently support complate:

* [Java](https://github.com/complate/complate-java) and an adaptor for the [Spring Framework](https://github.com/complate/complate-spring) ([Sample project](https://github.com/complate/complate-sample-spring-boot))
* complate works natively with JavaScript and we have an adaptor for the [Express Framework](https://github.com/complate/complate-sample-express) ([Sample project](https://github.com/complate/complate-sample-express))
* [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/complate/complate-ruby) ([Sample project](https://github.com/complate/complate-sample-rails))
